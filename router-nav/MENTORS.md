### **Mentor's Notes**

**Discuss the importance of using paths for routes.**
**Demonstrate how to use nested routes to create hierarchical navigation structures.**
**Explain how to handle URL parameters using `useParams`.**
**Provide examples of common navigation patterns and best practices.**

### **Detailed Explanations**

**`createBrowserRouter`:**

- Creates a router object that defines the application's routes.
- Takes an array of route definitions as input.

**`RouterProvider`:**

- Renders the router object and provides the routing context to the application.

**`Route`:**

- Defines a specific path and the element to render when that path is matched.
- Can have properties like `path`, `element`, and `children`.

**`Link`:**

- Creates navigation links that trigger URL changes without reloading the page.
- Has properties like `to` and `onClick`.

**`useParams`:**

- Accesses URL parameters within a route component.
- Can be used to dynamically render content based on the URL.

**Nested Routes:**

- Allows you to create hierarchical navigation structures.
- Can be used to organize your application into different sections.
